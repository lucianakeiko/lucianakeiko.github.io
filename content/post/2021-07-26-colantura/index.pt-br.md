## Letra
**Coloratura**  
We fell in through the clouds  
And everyone **before us** is there welcoming us now  
It's the end of **death** and **doubt**  
And loneliness **is out**  

Coloratura  
The place **we dreamed** about  
The melodies **inside yourself** and love come pouring out  
And **everyone's** allowed  
We're feathered by the crowd  

And up there in the **heavеns**  
[Galileo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileu_Galilei) and those pining for the moon  
Know it's a **slow burn**  
Through **Pioneer** and **Hеlix**  
Oumuamua, Heliopause and Neptune  
We're a **slow burning** tune  
But **we'll get there**, so for now  

In this **crazy world**, I do  
**I just want you**  

In the end it's all about  
**The love** you're **sending out**  

And **up there** in the heavens  
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon  
Saw the **world turn**  
Through Voyager, Callisto, Calliope, Betelgeuse, the Neon Moons  
We're a **slow burning** tune  
But we'll touch down soon, so will you  

And in this **crazy world**, I do  
I just want **you**  

And up there in the **heavens**  
Galileo saw **reflections** of us too  
Pluribus unum, [**unus mundus**](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Um_(filosofia))
All the satellites imbue  
The purple, yellow, green, red, orange and the blue  
Oh it's a crazy world, it's true  
**Sing it out**  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh  

And in this crazy world, I do  
I just want  
In this crazy world, **it's true**  
I just want you  

Poets prophesy up in the blue  
**Together**, that's how **we'll make it through**
